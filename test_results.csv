Thank you for reaching out to us for your paper supply needs for the upcoming conference. We appreciate your order request dated April 4, 2025, for 10,000 sheets of A4 paper, 5,000 sheets of A3 paper, and 500 reams of printer paper.

Unfortunately, I must inform you that we are currently unable to fulfill the order for A4 paper, as we only have 272 sheets available in stock.

Regarding pricing, please note that we do offer a volume discount of 15% for orders over 1,000 units, although the total amount is currently not calculable due to the insufficient stock for A4 paper.

If you're open to adjusting your order or would like to explore alternative options, please let us know. We aim to have everything delivered by April 15, 2025, as requested, but we would need to finalize the available quantities first.

Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to assisting you further. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or changes to your order.
